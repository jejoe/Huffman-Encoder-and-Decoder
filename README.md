# Huffman-Encoder-and-Decoder
The problem statement was to perform Huffman encoding and decoding using one of the three priority queue data structures from pairing heap, 4 way cache optimized heap and binary heap after checking which one of them takes the least time for heap creation. First a frequency table is created consisting of the unique values with their respective frequencies. This data is used for implementing all the three data structures and the runtime for heap creation is measured. Since the least time was taken by the 4 way cache optimized heap, it was used for providing minimum values for creating the Huffman tree for encoding
